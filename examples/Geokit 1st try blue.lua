-- Geokit 1st try: blue
-- On each geomap, draws blue.


When /map/ is geomap of box /bbox/:
    Wish (map) is highlighted "blue".
    -- I'm using a wish here, which is a sort of broadcast request for something in the world to be different: in this case, whenever I see a map, I wish for it to be highlighted in blue.
End
